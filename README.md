# CMPUT414-Skinning

This is the group project of Skinning topic in the course of CMPUT414

## Pinocchio Citing

The readme and license information for Pinocchio are available in the 
Pinocchio directory.

Authors of the code: Ilya Baran and Jovan Popovic, from their paper
"Automatic Rigging and Animation of 3D Characters" SIGGRAPH 2007.

## Dual Quaternion Library Citing

The code used for creating, manipulating, and transformting with dual 
quaternions is available in the following files:
* dual_quat_cu.hpp
* mat3.hpp
* point3.hpp
* quat_cu.hpp
* transfo.hpp
* vec3.hpp 

Author of code: Rodolphe Vaillant-David

## Our Changes / Contributions

We have modified the following files in order to combine pinocchio with
the dual quaternion skinning library:
* attachment.cpp

We created the following file to help with the interfacing between the 
different classes from each library:
* quatinterface.hpp
* quatinterface.cpp

## References

We used the following websites and papers to help us and as guides to 
integrating dual quaternions into pinocchio.
