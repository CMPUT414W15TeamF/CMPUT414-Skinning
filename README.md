# CMPUT414-Skinning

This is the group project of Skinning topic in the course of CMPUT414

* Proposal 
  
  Proposal is done on Feb 9th. The Proposal link is:
  
* Actual implementation 

  Our Literature review will be done on Feb 23rd.
  
  Actual implementation on coding for linear blend skinning algorithm implementation will start after Feb 23rd

* Timeline discussion
  
  Right now we figured out one way to do this:

    Each of the team can set up 5 tasks for one week, but 2 of them are optional.
    
    So it means, if at least 3 parts are deliverable, we can assume it's done 100% for the week.
    
Have fun and enjoy playing with our 3D animation
